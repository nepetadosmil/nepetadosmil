### Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I am myself (who would've guessed, right?). I'm a University student studying Software Engineering.

I fear what's commonly known as *fRoNtEnD dEvElOpMeNt*, and protect myself against it with backend development. When it comes to coding, I am obsessed with the words "efficiency" and "legibility". If my code doesn't meet these requirements to the best of my standards, I will trash it and rewrite it all over again as many times as I need to do it until it does.

ðŸ’¬ Motto: *"If you want a change, lead THE change."*
